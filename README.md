## About 🚀

As I said in the introduction, this is an online code editor with support 
for 6 programming languages (if we count HTML as well). It has a bunch of 
useful features that are compulsory for efficient and easier coding and 
programming. Some of them are hints, lint, folding, shortcuts, and so on. 
Additionally, every time you make a new file or if you change an existing 
one, it will be saved automatically. Then, you can delete your files or 
edit them again on the History page. Finally, there are lots of transitions, 
animations, and dark/light mode implemented just to make it all look a little 
prettier. Enjoy it! 😊🤗

## Project Goal and Lessons 💡🏁

At first, the aim of this project was to get familiar with Sass and JQuery. 
Throughout building it, I learned two important lessons. Sass is an incredible 
tool and saves time tremendously and makes dealing with CSS selectors much easier. 
That's the first lesson, and I will definitely use Sass in the future. Another is 
that JQuery these days, when we have all modern JS features, is not that useful. 
Especially, when you know to organize your JS code well and keep everything readable. 
Today, it is important to get familiar with JQuery because it is still widely used 
on the Web and you should be able to understand JQuery code. 🧠😉

Then, in the middle of the project, I came across some really interesting and 
important things when it comes to accessibility and I decided to make this code 
editor as accessible as possible. Some of the things I paid attention to are: 
using rem and em units instead of pixels, making all buttons focusable, using 
semantic HTML elements, keyboard access and content reordering, and adding labels 
and headings for screen readers. 📱💻🖥

Eventually, I said to myself why I wouldn't make a real online tool that I can 
use as a programmer as well as my colleagues. And I did it. As always, I learned 
or at least started to learn a lot of web technologies and tools that were 
extraneous to me and, of course, had great fun building CodeBursh. 💫💎
